    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The system identification problem is one of key problems for any systems with feedback. In this exercise, we are going investigate how machine learning (ML) can be used to solve such problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use power conversion as a real-world example. One of the most important metrics of any power management system is its **stability**. For example, in your laptop there is a power management IC (PMIC) that takes the 5 Volt from the wall charger and output a constant voltage for the CPU (usually 1.0-1.3 V). This voltage that goes into the CPU must be as stable as possible (high stability), under all kinds of processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below illustrates the problem. When there is any variation happening at the input side of the PMIC (such as a step), we look at the **output voltage waveform** for evaluating its stability before it goes into the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"coding_exercise.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "PMIC engineers have complicated methods to measure such output voltage waveforms and characterize them as *stable* or *unstable*. We want to see if ML can make their life easier!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use a dataset that was collected on ADI's high performance digital PMICs, called the [µModules](https://www.analog.com/en/product-category/umodule-regulators.html). The goal is to develop a ML model that can classify whether a output voltage waveform is stable or not, so that we won't burn the CPU!\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets consist of pairs of output voltage waveforms and their labels:\n",
    "- *voltage*: has shape (N, 8192), where N is the number of measured waveforms, and 8192 is the length of each waveform, as they are 1D time series. `voltage` is the output voltage waveform shown above.\n",
    "- *label*: has shape (N,). `label` ∈ {0, 1}, where 0 means unstable and 1 means stable.\n",
    "- *vout*: has shape (N,). `vout` is the \"steady-state\" values of each output voltage waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Completing the Coding Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be asked to go through the following 5 sub-problems. And we provide some guidance on what you should do in each of the sub-problem, as well as some skeleton code to get you started.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can insert your code in the corresponding sections with the best coding practice that you can follow (format, comment, etc). And then you should execute those cells to get the result. You can add any visualization to help illustrate your workflow and observation. The completed notebook should be clear and readable as a report.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you complete all the sub-problems, you should save the notebook and then download it with\n",
